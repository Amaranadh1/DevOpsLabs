=====
Earlier days to host an pplication will user a physical server (300GB RAM. 1TB HD,32 cpu's).
in order to deploy a java based application in physical server , we need to use  OS, Java ,Tomcat  ,War file  etc.

Q) to deploy single application , do we required all the space ?
No, 
So, remainign space will be wasted.

q} can i deploy another application in remaining space ? is this good to go?

No, we can't deploy.
One app--> one server

=========
Over the years Virtualization came into picture.

by using  virtualization we can do partition , and can use reqired space and give remaining space other to deploy their appliation.

in order to perform virtualization need to install  Hypervation on the mechine, then on ly it will allow to perform VM.
it is hardware level Virtualization.



Booting time :
=======================
 
 to launch an application it needs to run OS -->tomcat-->then app
 So, it is time taken process.
 
 
 Dynamic Allowcation :
 =======================
 more users are accessing my application and disk space is not enough , can i extend my harddisk.
 No, dynamically not possible.
 
 
 Scalability (increasing capacity)
 ================================
 Offers --> more customers are using the application so, need to increase the VM.
 in order to increase 10 more VM's how much time it takes?
 
 
 Containarization
 ==================
 ======================
 
 image  will be changed as container and run the application.
 
 
 
 Docker is a containaraization tool ,provide capability to create container and run conatiner and manage them.
 
 docker itself enable virtualization.
 
 docker OS level virtualization.
 
 the OS inside container is lightweight OS.
