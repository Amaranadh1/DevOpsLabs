When we call  Security two things will come into picture

a) Authentication
  (who are you)--with validating credentials it allow us to login.
b)Autherization
    allowing specific pages to visit.
    
    
 1)   Add more users :
    ------------------
    Manage Jenkins ---->Manage Users---->Create User
    
    Note : when user is added he/she won't get access to login. because Autherization access is require.
    
2)  Provide Autherization to the user:
    -----------------------------------
    Manage Jenkins--> Configure Global Security
